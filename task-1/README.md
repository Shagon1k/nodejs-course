# Summary

Let's begin our amazing journey to the world of Node.js and try to implement something very simple. Before we dive it, please make sure that the latest `LTS` (Long Term Support) version of Node.js is installed on your machine. You can verify that the the installation was done properly by running `node -v` or `node -version` commands. Once Node.js is installed, we'll create a simple script that will get a random number.

# Acceptance criteria

1. Solution for practical task contains `index.js` script with `getRandomNumber()` function exported by default. The function returns a random integer from 1 to 1000.
2. nodemon is installed as dev dependency.
3. `index.js` file is started via npm script command using `nodemon`
4. NVM is installed. Two versions of Node.js are installed - LTS one and the latest released one.
